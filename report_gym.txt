Pixabay is a good website to be used.
Make sure you make other folders as well css,js and img folders.
We have 2 images b.jpg that will be background and logo.jpg for logo.
Its good to check templates and designs of other fitness websites beforehand to have an idea ..just like we saw how navbar is kept fixed in them..we can use the inspect for that.
We are doing display:inline-block so that we can assign width later
position:absolute;
            right:34px;
            top:0px;                         # this will help to bring it in right

for setting mid one we can:
display:block;
            width:33%;
            margin:12px auto;

            and then set each one's top margin =20px;
To bring all elements of navbar in one line use inline-block:
.navbar li{
            display: inline-block;
        }
For making elements color white:                we need to do for anchor tag
.navbar li a
        {
            color:white;
        }
for removing underlines:
text-decoration:none;      text-decoration:underline                  for underlining
active to make it diff
filter:invert(100%)               to invert colors
text-align:center;                useful
cursor:pointer;                   to bring hand pointer
  .btn:hover                      if we need to change the color of hover

  in body
  body{
      use font-family:'Baloo Bhai';
  }


</head>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Baloo+Bhai&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
<body>



we can go to inspect and see the container that we hv created...we can change its margins and padding accordingly
to bring submit in center:
.container button
        {
            display:block;
            width:23%;
            margin:auto;
        }
